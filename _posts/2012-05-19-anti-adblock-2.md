*On a site I recently saw a [poll about adblock.](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/adblock-makeuseof-poll/) It showed that 90% of the users there actually used adblock. I know that it is a group of powerusers but I think that is disturbing and I will try to explain why.*

The main reason why I’m not using adblock is because it means that the sites I use don’t get ad revenue. A lot of people don’t seem to realize that sites can remain free through the ad revenue.

### Why do sites need ad-revenue?

Sites need ad-revenue to pay for several things. Web-servers aren’t free, I pay €12 a month for my server to host 2 sites plus €8 a year per domain. Do note that I only host small sites, the bigger the site, the higher the cost of the server.

### “Reasons” to block ads

Most users, however, find all kinds of excuses to block ads. Here are some:

#### I’m just one person, it doesn’t matter

This is a weak argument and you probably know it. You’re not the only one thinking this and to be honest, your ad click could make sure I can still pay for this server.

#### I don’t click on ads anyway

That actually doesn’t matter. Some ad-publishers pay-per-click and others pay-per-impression. In the last case, the site gets paid by just showing the ads. The site doesn’t get anything if you block the ad since that gets detected. Also, newspapers and TV-ads do the same. You see the ad, you know the product and you might want to look at it later.

#### I don’t want to support that site

Then don’t visit the site.

#### Those ads play music and/or video’s, it’s annoying

If a site has annoying ads, tell them. It’s usually so that the site can go to their control panel to blacklist certain ads. I, for example, have blocked all Ringtones &amp; Downloadables since they are usually scammy and end up costing the clicker a lot of money. I know that they would probably pay well but I wouldn’t feel good about it.

#### I whitelist the sites I use most

What about sites that have a REALLY good topic once, you only visit it once but don’t they deserve to get paid?


The only good reason I can think of is if your bandwidth is capped. I know that you need the bandwidth so that’s okay in my mind. [To be honest though, please donate then.](http://www.jeroenheijster.com/donate/)

I think that most reasons here should be good enough for you to disable adblock. If you have a good reason not to, please share the reason and I will try to convince you. Keep in mind that Google, FaceBook, reddit, YouTube, etc. couldn’t function without the ads.
