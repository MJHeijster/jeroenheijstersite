*Microsoft had a promotion that you would get a nice Nokia Longboard as an Xbox 360/WP7 avatar prop. This, however, did not go so well…*

[![](http://jeroenheijstercom.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/longboard.png "longboard")](http://jeroenheijstercom.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/longboard.png)The promotion itself was simple, sign up to the Microsoft Insider newsletter and get a free DLC code. The problem with this was that the code was not in the email, it was in the browser. Some people abused it and got a lot of codes out of it.

I signed up early for it but I got the following: “Wow! We had no idea that our avatar gear give-away would be so popular. **This promotion has now ended.**”

I’ve even seen someone sell the DLC codes for $9.99.

[Now Microsoft has said that it will give out another prop](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2012/05/21/on-xbox-avatars-and-stolen-skateboards.aspx) but to be honest, I wanted the longboard. I don’t want a foam finger.

> We are flattered that our avatar prop is so popular, but frustrated that someone abused the system to reserve a bunch of codes for themselves and shut out legitimate users in the process. We’ve now ended the promotion for the skateboard. **If you signed up for the newsletter (thanks, BTW!), got the invite for the gear and weren’t able to redeem your code, we will be making it right:** we will send you a code in the next few days for a different prop (a Windows Phone foam finger).

It sucks that people exploit systems like this, on the other hand Microsoft should have secured the system against abuse. This is a digital item, make it time limited, don’t limit it by number. It gives a bad name and a lot of negative publicity. Especially since they said that you would get the prop if you signed up.

<div></div># Update:

Microsoft made it up to the people who didn’t get the code the first time. I just redeemed mine and I have a nice prop for my avatar now. They learned from their mistake they made the first time, the code was included in the email itself instead of on a web site.

Kudos Microsoft, you made it up to me.
