The last half a year I have not written that much. This is due to several reasons. First off, I have graduated and I was busy with searching for work and later figuring everything out there. I also moved in with my girlfriend, which can be really time consuming.

So what about now? To be honest, I just bought a house. It’s not too big, but enough for now and enough for when I have a couple of kids. While the outside is renovated, the inside needs a lot of work. Thanks to friends I have been able to do a lot of work the last week. Most of the upstairs floor has been painted so if we keep it up, we should be able to move in the end of the month. I really look forward to that. Especially since I’ll have a small office here where I can experiment with some stuff. For example, I am going to install a home automation system.

Unless I get comments that you want the progress of the house, I’ll blog again when I have some more time.
